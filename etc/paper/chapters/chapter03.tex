\subsection{Why Go?}

\emph{Go} (also known as \emph{Golang}) is a relatively new programming language. It first appeared in 2009 and has gained a tremendous amount of popularity in the recent few years. \cite{wiki08} The language itself is a compiled, statically typed general purpose systems programming language. It is similar to C in many ways, but with memory safety, garbage collection and structural typing.

But why has it gained such popularity? The language itself is very small and easy to learn. Its features are pragmatic and carefully selected to fix problems with other mainstream languages. It encourages readability
